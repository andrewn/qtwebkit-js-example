This is a basic demo showing:
 - a Qt app running full-screen
 - exposing a javascript object from Qt

## app

The Qt app. You can compile it using Qt Creator.

The fullscreen call is in main.cpp
The javascript object is defined in main.qml

## server

A simple HTML page that outputs the contents of 
the window.qt object
